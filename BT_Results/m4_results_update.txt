Comparative Analysis: M3 vs M4 Backtest Results

  Key Behavioral Differences Confirmed:

  1. Position Holding Periods  

M3 (No time-stop):
  - AAPL: Jan 8 → Jan 22 = 14 days held
  - GOOGL: Jan 8 → Jan 19 = 11 days held
  - Positions could stay open indefinitely until TP/SL hit

  M4 (D+4 time-stop enforced):
  - ZERO positions exceed 4 trading days
  - 104 TimeStop exits at exactly D+4
  - Examples: AAPL Jan 8 → Jan 12 (4 days), META Jan 21 → Jan 25 (4 days)

 - D+4 time-stop working perfectly

  2. Stop-Loss Adjustments

  M3:
  - NO capture point logic
  - No SL adjustments found in entire backtest
  - Only static TP/SL exits

  M4:
  - Capture point at +4% triggers SL → breakeven+1%
  - Multiple "StopLoss_Adjusted" exits confirmed
  - Examples:
    - AAPL Feb 2: Exit @ breakeven+1%
    - META Feb 16: Exit @ breakeven+1%
    - META Sep 24: Exit @ breakeven+1%

  - Capture point logic working correctly
